/*
 * mq.styl -- contains variables and mixins related to media queries.
 *
 * We use four breakpoints, creating 5 different screen width ranges that may
 * be targeted:
 *
 *          400px       600px      800px        1050px
 * 
 * ─────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬─────
 *     'xs'        's'         'm'         'l'         'xl'
 *
 * The minimum and maximums for each point are stored in variables with names
 * following the form $breakpoint--size--<min/max>.
 * 
 * Rather than reference these variables directly in media queries, we leverage
 * block-level mixins to describe specific uses of these breakpoints. Notes:
 *
 * - Mixin names should follow the form mq--mixin-name.
 * - Use mobile-first techniques wherever practical.
 * - These mixins are created per unique usage, rather than per specific user
 *   agent you are looking to target. For example, if you want to show a
 *   hamburger menu on small devices, create a mixin called
 *   `mq--hamburger-menu` with mq--below($breakpoint--l-min). This allows us to
 *   tweak logical feature group breakpoints without making broad changes to
 *   the entire project.
